# Default Bacula Storage Daemon Configuration file
#
#  For Bacula release 9.4.4 (28 May 2019) -- redhat Enterprise release
#
# You may need to change the name of your tape drive
#   on the "Archive Device" directive in the Device
#   resource.  If you change the Name and/or the
#   "Media Type" in the Device resource, please ensure
#   that dird.conf has corresponding changes.
